# Linkedin_job_poasting_list
I found companies asked for an overwhelming amount of technologies. So I decided to compile that information into a single interface 

**Data Collection**

Ive web scrapped all the linkedin job posting all around india for data analyst, with the help of beautifulsoup library , Ive scrapped company name , job title , company location, job description, required skill set, job posted date , and companies linkedin id , and stored all the data in a csv file , I did for 5000 job posting 

**Data Cleansing**
Multiple cleansing procedures such as;

Removing major punctuation marks
Formatting data into a Pandas readable format
Lemmatisation
Appropriately splitting the data
Elimination of unrelated roles
Procedures can be found in within the formatting notebook and are streamlined in the pipeline.
